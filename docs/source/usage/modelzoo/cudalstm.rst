CudaLSTM
========

:py:class:`hy2dl.modelzoo.cudalstm.CudaLSTM` uses the standard PyTorch LSTM implementation. By modifying the configurations, multiple model variations based on the CudaLSTM can be implemented.

Standard case
-----------------
   The LSTM cell is used to analyze single-frequency data (e.g. daily data) in simulation mode. In the most standard case, we use the LSTM cell in a sequence-to-one configuration, where the model is trained to predict the next time step given a sequence (``seq_length``) of previous time steps. This case is ilustrated in the figure below.

      Standard case: LSTM sequence-to-one

   By modifying the configuration argument ``predict_last_n`` (default: 1) the LSTM cell can be used in a sequence-to-sequence configuration, where the model is trained to predict multiple time steps at once. This case is ilustrated in the figure below.

      :alt: LSTM sequence-to-sequence.
      :align: center

      LSTM sequence-to-sequence. In the case ilustrated here, ``predict_last_n = 3``
      
Multi-frequency
-----------------
   By modifying configuration arguments, multiple temporal resolutions (e.g. hourly and daily) can be processed. Depending on the amount of inputs per frequency, different embeddings can be used to map the inputs to a common shared dimension. Details of the configuration arguments related to this model can be found in :ref:`mf_reference` and :ref:`emb_reference`.

      :align: center

      Multi-frequency LSTM architecture that use a different embedding for each frequency.

   Configuration files for multi-frequency approaches can be found in the examples folder in the GitHub repository. For further details of the architecture see: `Acuna Espinoza et al. (2025b) <https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-29-1749-2025>`_. 

Forecast LSTM
-----------------
   By modifying configuration arguments, the LSTM cell rolls out continuously through both the hindcast and forecast periods, using specific embedding layers for each case. Details of the configuration arguments related to this model can be found in :ref:`fc_reference` and :ref:`emb_reference`.

   Configuration files for the forecast configuration can be found in the examples folder in the GitHub repository.

MDN LSTM
-----------------
   By modifying configuration arguments, the LSTM cell can be used with a mix-density network (MDN) output layer, enabling probabilistic predictions. Details of the configuration arguments related to this model can be found in :ref:`mdn_reference`.

   .. figure:: ../../_static/lstm_mdn.png
      :alt: LSTM with mix density network output layer.

   Configuration files for MDN approaches can be found in the examples folder in the GitHub repository. For further details of the architecture see: `Klotz et al. (2022) <https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-1673-2022>`_.

Nan-handling LSTM
-----------------
   By modifying configuration arguments, the LSTM cell can handle groups of missing data. The implemented nan-handling strategies are based on `Gauch et al. (2025) <https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-29-6221-2025>`_. Details of the configuration arguments related to this model can be found in :ref:`nan_reference`.

   .. figure:: ../../_static/masked_mean.png
      :alt: Masked mean nan-handling strategy
      :align: center

   Configuration files for nan-handling methods can be found in the examples folder in the GitHub repository.

Further combinations...
-----------------------
   Combining different approaches is possible. For example, one can define a configuration to implement a Forecast LSTM with multi-frequency approaches in the hindcast period, plus nan-handling capabilities and an MDN head layer.
